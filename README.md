# 🌱 Day 1: Personal Bio Page (HTML Essentials)

This is my **Day 1 project** from the **15-Day Frontend Developer Fast-Track Roadmap**.  
Focus: **HTML Tags, Forms, Semantic Structure**.

---

## 📖 What I Learned
- Difference between semantic tags (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`) and generic `<div>`.
- How to structure a page with sections and meaningful tags.
- Adding images with `<img>` and making them accessible with `alt`.
- Creating a simple form with `<form>` and `<input>`.

---

## 🛠️ Project Features
- A **header** with my name.
- An **About Me** section with a paragraph and profile picture.
- A **Contact Form** with fields for name and email.
- A **footer** with a copyright.
