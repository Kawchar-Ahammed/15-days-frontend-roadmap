# 🎨 Day 2: Styled Resume (CSS Basics)

This is my **Day 2 project** from the **15-Day Frontend Developer Fast-Track Roadmap**.

## 🎯 Focus:
- CSS Selectors  
- Colors and Fonts  
- Box Model  
- Basic Layout and Styling  

## 🧱 Project Description:
In this project, I created a **Styled Resume** using HTML and CSS.  
The goal was to practice **CSS selectors**, apply **color schemes**, and understand the **box model** to build a clean, structured resume layout.

## 🧩 Key Concepts Learned:
- CSS Selectors (`class`, `id`, `descendant`, `pseudo-class`)
- Box Model (margin, border, padding, content)
- Color Systems (HEX, RGB, RGBA, HSL)
- Font styling and text alignment
- Using `box-sizing: border-box` for consistent layouts

## 🚀 Mini Project:
**Project Name:** Styled Resume  
**Files:**  
- `index.html`  
- `style.css`  

📸 *Preview:*  
A simple, elegant resume layout with sections for profile, education, experience, and contact info.
